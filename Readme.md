# LogBot

> A Telegram bot that you can log to from Python and manage long running processes.

```
pip install logbot-telegram
```

## Quickstart

> **NOTE:** The following example is using a _demo_ bot that I personally host at [apiad.net:6778](http://apiad.net:6778). This bot can and will be stopped, restarted or even destroyed without notice. Refer to the section on **Setting your own** for more details.

First, go to Telegram and open a chat with [LogBot (Demo)](http://t.me/apiad_demo_logbot). You'll see this initial message.

Hit the **Start** button, and the bot will send you a *secret token*:

Now with this secret token you can communicate to the bot through HTTP. The protocol is very simple. Just a send a `POST` request to the bot's API with an encoded `json` data:

```bash
curl -XPOST http://apiad.net:6778 -d \
"{                                   \
    \"token\": \"ytp96gWZ8uHE\",     \
    \"msg\": \"Hello World\"         \
}"
```

VoilÃ¡, your message will be forwared to Telegram:

You can send messages with Markdown formatting:

```bash
curl -XPOST http://apiad.net:6778 -d \
"{                                   \
    \"token\": \"ytp96gWZ8uHE\",     \
    \"msg\": \"*Hello* _World_\"     \
}"
```

Finally, you can send **actions**, that will be rendered as buttons in Telegram.
When you click the button, and **only when you click it**, you will get a response back with the clicked option:

```bash
curl -XPOST http://apiad.net:6778 -d    \
"{                                      \
    \"token\": \"ytp96gWZ8uHE\",        \
    \"msg\": \"Wanna try?\",            \
    \"actions\": [\"Yes\", \"No way\"]  \
}"
{"msg":"Wanna try?","response":"Yes"}
```

> **NOTE:** By default you have 60 seconds to answer before a response timeout is raised. This hard limit might be changed in future versions.

## Python API

If you talk Python, you can clone this project and use a set of simple tools to skip all that `curl`.

```
pip install logbot-telegram
```

* `send` simply sends the message.

```python
>>> from logbot import Client
>>> c = Client(token="<token>", host="http://apiad.net", port=6778)
>>> c.send("Hello World")
```

* `ask` will send the corresponding questions as buttons and return the reply:

```python
>>> c.ask("Do you?", "A", "B", "C")
'C' # Supposedly you hit C in Telegram
```

* `yes` will simply send `Yes` and `No` and return `True` or `False`:

```python
>>> if c.yes("Do you?"):
>>>     print("It does!")
'It does!' # Supposedly you hit Yes in Telegram
```

These are also available as simple functions, which receive `token`, `host` and `port` on every call. The `Client` class just simplifies passing those values all the time.

## What can I do with this?

Some simple ideas:

* **Log directly into Telegram from your code**. For example, using Python `request` you can easily make any long-running script to periodically send updates.
* **Monitor a server**. Using `bash`, `curl` and `cron` you can send yourself periodically info about your CPU, memory and I/O ussage.
* **Quick responses on Telegram**. By using the response actions, you can interact with running code, either to take decisions, kill long running processes, retry things that broke, etc. Your imagination is the limit.

## Setting up your own

For testing, and while my server handles it, you can use the bot I have set up. It's free and for that reason I might decide to turn it off at any given time without any advice. So, if you want a long time working solution, you will have to set up your own.

* First, create your Telegram bot with [BotFather](t.me/botfather). If you don't know what I mean, read the Telegram documentation on bots. It's all over the Internet.
* Second, BotFather will give you a `TOKEN`. Make sure to write it down.
* Third, `pip install logbot-telegram`.
* Finally, `export TOKEN=<your-token>`.
* You can run `pipenv run python -m logbot` now. It will listen by default at `localhost:6778`.
* You can change the `HOST` and `PORT` with environment variables.
